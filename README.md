# Front-End Deep Practice

A focused journey to deeply practice front-end development by building small, real-world projects.  
Inspired by Daniel Coyle's *The Talent Code*.
**Emphasizing struggle, mistakes, and rapid growth through deep practice**.

## Goals
- Build real UI components and small applications from scratch.
- Strengthen HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic API usage.
- Improve problem-solving, debugging, and clean code habits.
- Develop the ability to build without relying on tutorials.
- Embrace mistakes as the fastest way to grow.

## Rules
- Allocate a dedicated time block to build a project.
- No tutorials during coding. (Look things up if needed, but struggle first.)
- Focus on clean, readable code.
- Reflect after each build:
  - What went wrong?
  - How did I fix it?
  - What can I improve next time?
